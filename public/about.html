<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Devnaah Padidam, but you may also know me as Chenchu Maha Lakshmi
  Padidam. I'm a dedicated professional and a passionate student of computer
  science, always eager to learn and grow in this dynamic field. My journey
  began in Chennai, India, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics
  and Communication Engineering. Now, I'm deepening my knowledge through a
  Master's degree in Computer Science at Drexel University in Philadelphia. My
  academic pursuits have led me to explore areas such as Web Designing, Python
  Programming, Java Programming, Software Design, and more. I've also worked on
  exciting projects like a community information site and my personal web
  portfolio.

  Before moving to the United States for my postgraduate studies, I accumulated
  valuable experience as a Senior Associate at Logic Tree IT Solutions in
  Hyderabad, India. In this role, I honed my skills in project collaboration,
  developing test specifications, and problem-solving during team discussions.
  Throughout all these experiences, my primary goal was to ensure customer
  satisfaction and contribute to the continual improvement of our team's
  processes.

  Professionally, I'm well-versed in a wide array of programming languages,
  including Python, Java, C, and JavaScript. My frontend development skills
  encompass HTML5 and CSS3, and I have hands-on experience in database
  management with MySQL and MS SQL server. Tools and libraries like Visual
  Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas are integral to my
  workflow, and I'm also adept at data visualization with Tableau. Committed to
  lifelong learning, I've enriched my knowledge through certifications from
  Tejas Networks and DWBIADDA.COM. When I'm not coding or learning, you can find
  me volunteering, organizing events, or exploring nature through hiking. I'm
  thrilled to see what the future holds and how I can further contribute to the
  exciting world of computer science!
